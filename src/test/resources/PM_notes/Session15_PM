SESSION 15: Notes
   **************************************************************
   to integrate and run the collections at org leverl
   ---------------------2 ways
   1. to move the collections onto github.com from where jenkins job
   would pick up-with the url specified and run the collection
   2. Move the collection json file on to jenkins dashboard and create  a job and run the collection
   ----how to integrate newman with jenkins??
   so far we have been running newman from cmd prompt/cli
   using the cmd
   newman run collectionName -e envName --verbose
   ----after exporting the collec + env from PM dashboard to the LFS
   ----changing the directory from cmd line and staying inside the folder
   where the collection exist and then running the newman run cmd
   ----now we will see how to run the same cmd like in jenkins
   what is the advantage of usage of jenkins???
   we can create the jobs to run the coll's whenever we want to
   ---any one in the team can open the jenkins, run the coll and share the
   results with other team members
   And we can integrate with CICD pipeline also
   What is the advantage of integration of pm colls with jenkins??
   We can create the jobs as and when required and run the colls from
   jenkins server--so every one from the team gets to do that when
   requrired, to get the reports from jenkins and analyse the reports
   --can integrate with CICD pipelines
   HOW TO SET UP JENKINS AND CREATE A JOB CONFIGURATION??
   create a free style job on jenkins and run the job
   WAR: is also a form of java technology-web archive file

   How to install jenkins?? jdk 11, 17, OR 21 is mandatory
   installation link:

   go to google: write download jenkins war-go to war pkgs

   to run jenkins.war file
   java -jar jenkins.war
   ----------to remove weird coutput on jenkins--
   open cmd ---ctrl+c ---terminates
   cls --clears the screen
   ALWAYS START UR JENKINS WITH THE BELOW CMD^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   java  -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar jenkins.war

   after running the above cmd, 
   ---will see the mesg 'Jenkins is up and running' on cmd line
   open the browser and hit local host:8080
   By default jenkins will be running on port no: 8080

   http://localhost:8080/login?from%2F 

   DO NOT ENTER CMD + C, CTRL+C, OR CLOSE THE CMD PROMPT--will
   stop jenkins from running==> jenkins server will be terminated

   ------once every thing is done --we have to proceed with jenkins
   now we have the collections on the LFS-where postman_collections folder is
   ---now our target is to run the coll's from jenkins server
   --can be done in 2 ways 
   1]--either by pushing the coll's on to Github-and get the url-create
   a job on jenkins using the url and run the coll's
   2]---OR directly create the workspace on jenkins server and provide the
   path for the coll's + env's and create job and run the coll's directly
   from jenkins
   -----on google write-newman html 
   click on link
   newman-reporter-htmlextra
   _________________________

   to get the report(to look like the above one)--cmd to be used
   npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra

   how to set up the newman-reporter-htmlextra pkg in jenkins??
   Goto Jenkins--->Dashboard--click on ManageJenkins---go to Tools tab
   scroll down on the page--and click on NodeJSinstallations
   -----in the field of Global npm pkges to install
   previously we entered newman --besides it -give a space and enter
   --newman-reporter-htmlextra 
   *****now which flag do we have to supply 
   newman run collection.json -r htmlextra
   -------now go back to jenkins dashboard-go to the job u were working on
   --here sampleAPIjob--configure--add besides json, htmlextra
   apply-save
   --Buildnow
   -----after the job is run --chk the newman folder-to see the html report
   BUT this html reports look and feel is not up to the mark
   so we have to add an extra plugin--content security policy plugin

   so on google-type 'download content security policy extension'
   --click on this link
   Disable Content-security policy-chrome webstore - Google

   ---what exactly it does -is disable the CSP policy in the jenkins and
   then all the look and feel will be properly visible over there
   ---on that link --simply click on 'add to chrome'

TO PARAMETERIZE: the job
   copying the cmd from jobname--configure

=======================
   newman run C://Users//binduk//Documents//JulyEleAPIbatch//NewSample15_coll.json -e C://Users//binduk//Documents//JulyEleAPIbatch//newGoRest_env.json -n 3 -r cli,htmlextra
